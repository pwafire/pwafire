### Get Started with PWA Fire Bundle
[PWA Fire Bundle](https://twitter.com/pwafire) is an open source [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) **javascript** and **json** [Bundle](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/pwafire-bundle/default) that allows you to convert your website into a [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) or build one in a few minutes. 

It is the most simplest way you can ever convert your web app or website into a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) and still have some fun with the code. It doesn't make you a lazy code beast.
