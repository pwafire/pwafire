# PWAfire Library Documentation - A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

PWAfire is an open-source library designed to simplify the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) by providing a unified interface to modern web capabilities. This library serves as an "API of APIs," bundling various Progressive Web App features into a single, easy-to-use package.

## Core Concepts

Progressive Web Apps represent a modern approach to web development that allows websites to offer app-like experiences to users. PWAfire streamlines the implementation of PWA features by providing a consistent interface across different browsers and platforms.

## Installation Options

You have two primary methods to incorporate PWAfire into your project:

### NPM Installation

For projects using Node.js package management:

```bash
npm i pwafire --save
```

### CDN Integration

For direct browser usage through ES6 modules:

Latest version:

```javascript
import { pwa } from "https://unpkg.com/pwafire/esm/index.js";
```

For stability in production environments, you can specify a particular version:

```javascript
import { pwa } from "https://unpkg.com/pwafire@3.0.8/esm/index.js";
```

## Feature Detection System

PWAfire includes a sophisticated feature detection system that helps developers implement graceful fallbacks when certain PWA features aren't available in the user's browser. This system is particularly valuable for creating robust, cross-browser compatible applications.

### Using Feature Detection

The library provides two main approaches to feature detection:

1. **Individual Feature Checking**:

```javascript
import { check } from "pwafire";

// Async function to check if sharing is supported
async function checkShareSupport() {
    const isShareSupported = await check.Share();
    if (isShareSupported) {
        // Implement sharing functionality
    } else {
        // Provide alternative solution (e.g., copy to clipboard)
    }
}
```

2. **Comprehensive Feature Assessment**:

```javascript
import { check } from "pwafire";

async function checkAllFeatures() {
    const supportedFeatures = await check.All();
    // Returns an object containing support status for all available APIs
}
```

## Supported Web Capabilities

PWAfire supports a comprehensive set of modern web capabilities, all of which have been tested and stabilized. Here are the key features available:

### Core Features

1. **Custom Installation**: Enables customized PWA installation experiences
2. **Background Sync**: Allows data synchronization even when the app is not active
3. **Badging**: Supports app badge updates for notifications
4. **Contact Picker**: Provides access to device contacts (with user permission)
5. **Screen Wake Lock**: Prevents device screen from sleeping
6. **Content Indexing**: Enables offline content discovery
7. **Clipboard Operations**:
   - Text copying and reading
   - Image copying
   - File reading capabilities

### Communication Features

1. **Push Notifications**: Enables sending updates to users
2. **Web Share**: Allows content sharing between applications
3. **Web Payments**: Supports integrated payment processing

## Implementation Examples

Here's a practical example of implementing sharing functionality in a React application:

```javascript
import { pwa } from "pwafire";

function ShareComponent() {
    const shareContent = async () => {
        const data = {
            title: "PWAfire Example",
            text: "Check out this awesome PWA library!",
            url: "https://docs.pwafire.org"
        };
        
        try {
            await pwa.Share(data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Sharing failed:", error);
        }
    };
    
    return <button onClick={shareContent}>Share</button>;
}
```

## Community and Support

The PWAfire community provides several channels for support and collaboration:

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available at docs.pwafire.org
2. **Developer Support**: Active community on Twitter (@pwafire)
3. **Real-time Help**: Available through their Slack workspace
4. **Contribution**: Open to feature proposals through GitHub Issues

## Development Considerations

When implementing PWAfire in your project, consider these best practices:

1. Always implement feature detection before using advanced capabilities
2. Provide fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
3. Test across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior
4. Keep up with version updates for security and feature improvements
